    "In this lab, we saw a few simple examples of Bayesian logic and how we can add prior information to our calculation, in order to update our beliefs about the certain events. Bayesian logic works in numerous ways and it is not within the scope of this section to give you a deep dive in complex Bayesian problems. You are advised to re-visit the provided links when you have a better understanding of Bayesian inference. "
